<p>Letâ€™s first pit the projected population growth against the recorded
population development (= benchmark) using one-year age classes (default
option). Make sure to pass matching data frames, especially in terms of
the year ranges. To remove the start population (2018) from the
projection results, you could also use
<code>drop_start_year = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>As a result of <code><a href="../reference/prepare_evaluation.html">prepare_evaluation()</a></code>, you get the
recorded (<code>n_bench</code>) and projected (<code>n_proj</code>)
population for each demographic group and year next to each other:</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can use weights. The adjusted metric
<code>w_abs_perc_e</code> considers that smaller groups tend to have
larger forecast errors. As a result, adjusted absolute percentage errors
weigh less heavily in smaller groups than in larger groups.</p>
