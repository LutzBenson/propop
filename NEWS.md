# propop 0.1.0

## Development history and earlier versions

The `propop` package is a successor of `staagBevProj` (not publicly available), 
which was last updated in December 2022. `staagBevProj` was developed by 
Tina Cornioley, Jan Wunder, and Niklas Haffert. Andrea Pl√ºss made conceptual 
contributions to the initial package.

`propop` was developed by Norah Efosa and Adrian Gadient (Statistik Aargau). 
The main innovations are:

- Clearer separation between code that prepares data and code that runs the 
projection
-	Centrally united FSO parameters and corrections / adjustments; these are now 
gathered in a single data frame that is passed to the projection function
-	Only one function to run projections (rather than projectPop and projectAll)
-	Convenience functions to directly download data and parameters from STAT-TAB
-	Incorporation of assertions and unit tests
-	Function to evaluate projection results 
-	Clearer documentation
