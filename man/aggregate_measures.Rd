\title{Compute aggregate evaluation measures per model variant}
\usage{
aggregate_measures(data, weight_groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame created with function \code{compute_measures}.}

\item{weight_groups}{character, optional argument indicating one or more
column names to obtain evaluation criteria weighted for specific groups
(e.g., age groups, nationality).}
}
\value{
A data frame. The data frame includes the following summary measures:
\itemize{
\item \code{m_perc_e} is the mean percentage error (MPE; or mean algebraic percentage
error MALPE); it is a bias indicator as it takes the \bold{direction} of the
error into account. Positive values indicate overestimation and negative
values indicate underestimation. The smaller the value, the lower the bias.
\item \code{md_perc_e} is the median percentage error (MedPE).
\item \code{m_abs_perc_e} is the mean \bold{absolute} percentage (or: proportional)
error (MAPE). In contrast to \code{wm_abs_per_e} (see below), it gives equal
weighting to each absolute percentage error of which it is the mean (1/n).
It considers variance (or amplitude) and can be seen as a measure
of precision. The smaller the value, the lower is the average relative error.
\item \code{md_abs_perc_e} is the median \bold{absolute} percentage error (MedAPE).
\item \code{wm_abs_perc_e} is the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE); it
weights each absolute percentage error by the population size of the focal
group (e.g., municipality, nationality, age group) and thus considers domain
size. Put differently, errors count more in populous groups than in less
populous groups.
\item \code{rmse} is the root mean square error; it is an indication of robustness of
the projection. The smaller the value, the more robust the projection.
\item \code{n_measure} is the number of times a summary measure occurs (per weight
group if requested),
\item \code{p_under_1} is a measure to gauge the error distribution; it indicates the
proportion of observations that have absolute percentage errors smaller than
1\%.
\item \code{p_1_to_5} is a measure to gauge the error distribution; it indicates the
proportion of observations that have absolute percentage errors between 1\%
and 5\%.
\item \code{p_under_5} is a measure to gauge the error distribution; it indicates the
proportion of observations that have absolute percentage errors smaller than
5\%.
\item \code{p_5_to_10} is a measure to gauge the error distribution; it indicates the
proportion of observations that have absolute percentage errors between 5\%
and 10\%.
\item \code{p_over_10} is a measure to gauge the error distribution; it indicates the
proportion of observations that have absolute percentage errors larger than
10\%.

\description{
Returns descriptive summary statistics of model accuracy and bias measures
across demographic groups and years. The returned statistics are particularly
useful for comparing the model performance for different groups or different
models.
